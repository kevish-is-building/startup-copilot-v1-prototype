Consult with a startup lawyer (budget $1,500-$3,000)\n2. Use a formation service (Clerky, Stripe Atlas) for $500-$1,000\n3. File with your state\n4. Obtain an EIN from the IRS\n5. Set up a business bank account\n\nRemember: you can always convert from an LLC to a C-Corp later, but it's easier to start with the right structure."

      "content": "# Founders' Agreement: Avoiding Co-Founder Conflicts\n\nCo-founder disputes are one of the top reasons startups fail. A solid founders' agreement prevents most issues.\n\n## Critical Elements\n\n### 1. Equity Split\n\n**Equal vs. Unequal**\n- Equal splits work when contributions are truly balanced\n- Unequal splits reflect different levels of commitment, expertise, or initial contributions\n\n**Dynamic Equity Models**\nSome teams use formulas that adjust equity based on ongoing contributions.\n\n### 2. Vesting Schedule\n\n**Standard**: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff\n- After 1 year, 25% of shares vest\n- Remaining 75% vests monthly over 3 years\n\n**Why Vesting Matters**\nProtects the company if a founder leaves early. Without vesting, a departing founder keeps 100% of their equity.\n\n### 3. Roles and Responsibilities\n\nClearly define:\n- Who is CEO?\n- Who handles what functional areas?\n- Expected time commitment\n- Compensation (if any)\n\n### 4. Decision-Making Process\n\n**Unanimous Consent Required For**:\n- Raising funding\n- Selling the company\n- Hiring/firing executives\n- Major pivots\n- Taking on debt over $X\n\n**Majority Vote For**:\n- Day-to-day operations\n- Hiring/firing non-executive employees\n- Product decisions\n\n### 5. Intellectual Property Assignment\n\nAll IP created by founders must be assigned to the company. This includes:\n- Code\n- Designs\n- Business processes\n- Trade secrets\n\n### 6. What Happens If Someone Leaves?\n\n**Voluntary Departure**\n- Unvested shares are forfeited\n- Vested shares remain (or buyback option)\n\n**Termination for Cause**\n- Definition of \"cause\"\n- Buyback rights at fair market value\n\n**Death or Disability**\n- Acceleration of vesting?\n- Buyback arrangements\n\n### 7. Non-Compete and Non-Solicit\n\n**Non-Compete**\n- Reasonable duration (typically 1-2 years)\n- Geographic scope\n- Industry specificity\n\n**Non-Solicit**\n- Prevents poaching employees\n- Protects customer relationships\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Waiting too long** - Have this conversation in the first month\n2. **Avoiding difficult topics** - Address worst-case scenarios upfront\n3. **Verbal agreements** - Always put it in writing\n4. **Not using vesting** - This is non-negotiable\n5. **Ignoring tax implications** - File 83(b) elections within 30 days\n\n## The Conversation Framework\n\nSchedule a dedicated session to discuss:\n- Individual motivations and goals\n- Expected time commitments\n- Risk tolerance\n- Exit expectations\n- Worst-case scenarios\n\n## Getting Help\n\nInvest in a good startup lawyer. Budget $2,000-$5,000 for:\n- Founders' agreement\n- Stock purchase agreements\n- IP assignments\n- 83(b) election filings\n\nThis is money well spent to avoid six-figure legal fees later."

      "content": "# SAFE vs. Priced Round: Which is Right for You?\n\nWhen raising your first capital, you'll likely choose between a SAFE and a priced equity round.\n\n## What is a SAFE?\n\nSAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) is an investment contract that converts to equity in a future priced round.\n\n**Created by**: Y Combinator in 2013\n**Purpose**: Simplify early-stage fundraising\n\n### SAFE Mechanics\n\n**Key Terms**:\n- **Valuation Cap**: Maximum valuation at which the SAFE converts\n- **Discount**: Percentage discount on the next round's price (typically 15-20%)\n- **MFN (Most Favored Nation)**: Right to same terms as future SAFEs\n\n**Example**:\n- You raise $500K on a SAFE with a $5M cap\n- Later, you raise a Series A at a $10M valuation\n- SAFE investors convert at the $5M cap (better terms)\n- They get 2x the shares compared to Series A investors\n\n## SAFE Advantages\n\n1. **Speed**: Close in days, not weeks\n2. **Lower legal costs**: $2K vs. $15K+ for priced round\n3. **No valuation needed**: Defer valuation discussion\n4. **No board seats**: Simpler governance initially\n5. **Flexible**: Add investors as you find them\n\n## SAFE Disadvantages\n\n1. **Dilution uncertainty**: Don't know exact ownership until conversion\n2. **Investor protection**: Fewer rights than priced equity\n3. **Multiple SAFEs complexity**: Different terms can create messy cap tables\n4. **Not equity**: Some investors prefer actual ownership\n\n## Priced Equity Rounds\n\nIn a priced round, you set a specific valuation and sell a percentage of your company.\n\n**Example**:\n- $5M pre-money valuation\n- Raise $1M\n- Post-money: $6M\n- Investors own: 16.7%\n\n## Priced Round Advantages\n\n1. **Clear ownership**: Everyone knows exact percentages\n2. **Investor protections**: Liquidation preferences, pro-rata rights, etc.\n3. **Board representation**: More formal governance\n4. **Psychological milestone**: Validates your valuation\n\n## Priced Round Disadvantages\n\n1. **Time-consuming**: 6-12 weeks to close\n2. **Expensive**: $15K-$50K in legal fees\n3. **Valuation pressure**: Must agree on a number\n4. **All-or-nothing**: Usually need to close everyone at once\n\n## When to Use Each\n\n### Use a SAFE When:\n- Raising less than $2M\n- Pre-product or pre-traction\n- Want to move quickly\n- First-time founders\n- Angels and small funds\n\n### Use a Priced Round When:\n- Raising $2M+\n- Strong traction and metrics\n- Institutional investors requiring it\n- Clear valuation comps\n- Ready for board structure\n\n## SAFE Best Practices\n\n1. **Use standard Y Combinator templates** - Don't customize\n2. **Consistent terms** - Same cap and discount for all investors\n3. **Reasonable caps** - Not too high (dilution risk for founders)\n4. **Track carefully** - Maintain a detailed cap table\n5. **Plan for conversion** - Understand the math before Series A\n\n## Avoid SAFE Traps\n\n**Too Much SAFE Money**\nRaising multiple SAFE rounds at increasing caps can create:\n- Massive dilution at conversion\n- Messy cap tables\n- Series A investor concerns\n\n**Rule of Thumb**: Don't raise more than $2M on SAFEs\n\n**No Cap or Discount**\nSome SAFEs have neither - avoid these unless you're desperate. Investors should take some risk for early support.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nFor most seed-stage startups:\n- **$0-500K**: SAFEs are perfect\n- **$500K-$2M**: SAFEs still make sense\n- **$2M+**: Consider a priced round\n\nWhen in doubt, talk to your lawyer and other founders who've been through it."

      "content": "# The Perfect Pitch Deck: What Investors Want to See\n\nYour pitch deck is often your first impression with investors. Here's how to make it count.\n\n## The 10-Slide Formula\n\n### 1. Cover Slide\n- Company name and tagline\n- Your name and title\n- Contact information\n- Optional: impressive logo or visual\n\n### 2. Problem\n- What painful problem are you solving?\n- Show the current broken solution\n- Make it visceral and relatable\n\n**Do**: \"Sales teams waste 20 hours/week on manual data entry\"\n**Don't**: \"There's inefficiency in the sales process\"\n\n### 3. Solution\n- Your product in 1-2 sentences\n- Show screenshots or demo\n- Focus on the \"aha\" moment\n\n### 4. Why Now?\n- What's changed that makes this possible?\n- Market trends, technology shifts, behavior changes\n- Creates urgency and reduces timing risk\n\n### 5. Market Size\n- TAM (Total Addressable Market)\n- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)\n- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)\n\n**Show your work**: Bottom-up calculation is more credible than top-down\n\n### 6. Product/Demo\n- Key features and user experience\n- Show, don't tell\n- Focus on value, not features\n\n### 7. Traction\n- Revenue growth\n- User metrics\n- Key partnerships\n- Press/awards\n\n**Remember**: Early stage? Show momentum, not just absolute numbers\n\n### 8. Business Model\n- How do you make money?\n- Pricing strategy\n- Unit economics (CAC, LTV)\n- Path to profitability\n\n### 9. Competition\n- Competitive landscape\n- Your unique differentiation\n- Avoid saying \"no competitors\"\n\n**Best format**: 2x2 matrix showing your unique positioning\n\n### 10. Team\n- Founders and key employees\n- Relevant experience and expertise\n- Why are you uniquely qualified?\n- Show complementary skills\n\n### 11. Ask\n- How much are you raising?\n- What will you use it for?\n- What milestones will you hit?\n- What's next after this round?\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Visual Hierarchy\n- One main point per slide\n- Large fonts (30pt minimum)\n- Minimal text (headlines, not paragraphs)\n- High-quality images\n\n### Consistency\n- Use a template (Pitch, Canva, or hire a designer)\n- Consistent fonts and colors\n- Professional, not gimmicky\n\n### Data Visualization\n- Charts over tables\n- Show trends, not just numbers\n- Make growth obvious\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n1. **Too much text** - If you need paragraphs, create a separate \"reading deck\"\n2. **Unclear ask** - Be specific about round size and use of funds\n3. **Boring problem** - Make investors feel the pain\n4. **No differentiation** - Why you, why now?\n5. **Weak team slide** - Investors bet on people\n6. **Unrealistic projections** - Show ambition but stay credible\n\n## Two Versions\n\n### Presentation Deck (10-12 slides)\n- Visuals-heavy\n- Minimal text\n- For live pitches\n\n### Reading Deck (15-20 slides)\n- More detail\n- Can stand alone\n- For email sends\n\n## The Appendix\n\nInclude backup slides for Q&A:\n- Detailed financials\n- Go-to-market strategy\n- Product roadmap\n- Additional team bios\n- Press and testimonials\n\n## Storytelling Framework\n\nGreat pitches follow this narrative arc:\n\n1. **Setup**: Here's the world as it is (problem)\n2. **Conflict**: This is broken and painful\n3. **Resolution**: We've built the solution\n4. **Proof**: Here's evidence it's working\n5. **Vision**: Here's where we're going\n6. **Ask**: Join us on this journey\n\n## Final Checks\n\n- [ ] Could someone understand your company from the deck alone?\n- [ ] Is there one clear point per slide?\n- [ ] Have you shown (not told) wherever possible?\n- [ ] Does your traction slide make investors excited?\n- [ ] Is your ask clear and specific?\n- [ ] Would YOU be excited to invest based on this deck?\n\n## Resources\n\n- Study successful pitch decks: Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn\n- Use: pitch.com, beautiful.ai, or Canva for templates\n- Get feedback from: advisors, other founders, angels\n\nRemember: Your deck is a conversation starter, not a comprehensive business plan. Keep it focused, visual, and compelling."
